Guide for starting a local farmer's market stall to talk to your communities

Start by calling around your local markets and asking how to start an information booth
Mine is $30 for a table

Talk about what is required of you, can you sell anything like hand made items.

Bring it up in your local meetup.  Organize a few people willing to hang there and share shifts.
Make a logo and a link or qr code for your meetup if people want to learn more.
Get it printed on a banner to hang up.

Create a simple website if you don't have one already.
Actionable bitcoin only advice.

Organize your things for market day.
Folding tables at target are pretty easy to get.  Tablecloth (old flat sheets work great).
Plastic storage crate with a solid lid to store all your items.  These are mostly waterproof.
You WILL get rain sometimes if you are outdoors.  Have some small towels, terrycloth or papertowels.

Ideally you can pack everything into the one tub, walk it from your vehicle to your table and setup.
If you need a table, the foldable target ones can be carried in one hand.

Banners, books, pamphlets
Stickers, trinkets.
