Organize your things for market day.
Folding tables at target are pretty easy to get.  Tablecloth (old flat sheets work great).
Plastic storage crate with a solid lid to store all your items.  These are mostly waterproof.
You WILL get rain sometimes if you are outdoors.  Have some small towels, terrycloth or papertowels.

Ideally you can pack everything into the one tub, walk it from your vehicle to your table and setup.
If you need a table, the foldable target ones can be carried in one hand.
